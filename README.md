# Energy Management System

This Energy Management System (EMS) is a simple .NetCore app capturing energy telemetry data from photovoltaik system and smart meter and controlling an EV wallbox with the surplus energy available from local production. This is running on Linux on a Raspberry Pi and has a cloud connection to a Microsoft Azure dashboard. 

## Future Extensions
As a next step, a heat pump will also be managed by the system and (once this is available in 2023) the connected EV battery will be used as an additional energy source during the night via Vechile-to-Home (V2H) leveraging EEBUS (see seperate EEBus.Net repo for a reference implementation).

## Telemetry Data Captured
1. Weather data from [www.openweathermap.org](http://www.openweathermap.org), as the weather impacts PV performance.
2. Telemetry data from the PVâ€™s inverter (The inverter uses the [Fronius API](https://www.fronius.com/en/photovoltaics/products/all-products/system-monitoring/open-interfaces/fronius-solar-api-json-)). A [SunSpec](https://sunspec.org)-compliant version using ModbusTCP is in the works.
3. Smart meter telemetry data leveraging its [IEC 62056-21 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62056) optical interface using [a USB reader](https://shop.weidmann-elektronik.de/index.php?page=product&info=24). IEC 62056-21 uses the Smart Message Language - [SML](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SML).
4. Wallbe Wallbox configuration using surplus energy from the PV to charge an Electric Vehicle.

Telemetry is sent to a Microsoft Azure IoT Central application based on the [IoT Central energy app templates](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/build/energy).
The device template for the app can be found [here](./PV-Monitor.json).
